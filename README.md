#Car-dealer-app

To run the project you should fork it form https://github.com/aedricson/car-dealer-app, install the packages,
and run command "npm run dev";
In this project I completed the main task: added dropdowns and button that navigates to results page, fetching data from server and showing it using client and server components.

Unfortunately I did not complete some important things because it was my first practical experience using Next.js and lack of time.
Thing that can be improved:
- Error/loading handling in client components;
- Styling using Tailwind;
- Creating properly variables including .env;
- Build application and deploy to the gh pages.

I can improve things that I mentioned above after the review.
